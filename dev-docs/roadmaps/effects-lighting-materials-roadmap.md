# Effects, Lighting and Materials Roadmap

Placeholder for roadmap on improved scenegraph and loaders support

### MultiPass Rendering

### Roadmap / Ideas

* `TransformPass` ? - Does a transform feedback pass fit into / make sense in the multi pass system?
* Temporal Passes - add a "shake" or "shock wave" or "blur" pass that plays and the removes/disables itself? A stack of playing passes?
* Image Effects, add toon effects etc.
* FPS limits, priorities, disable passes when FPS drops?


### PSSM Shadowmaps
